# diabetes-detection
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can 
accurately detect the presence of diabetes in patients based on medical data. The project 
uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes various health-related parameters 
such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, age, and insulin level. 
The goal is to apply two different machine learning algorithms — Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) and Decision Tree — to train classification models, evaluate their accuracy, and 
compare their performance. By analyzing the results, the project aims to identify which 
algorithm performs better for diabetes prediction and how effectively machine learning 
can be used in medical diagnosis.
